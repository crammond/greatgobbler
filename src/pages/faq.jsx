    <h3>What happens in the event of inclement weather?</h3>
    <p>
      It is unlikely the race will be postponed due to inclement weather. This race has been run in the snow several times. Any postponement will be announced on this website and on our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/greatgobbler5knashua' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">"Great Gobbler Thanksgiving Day 5k" Facebook page</a>. If you don’t see an announcement that means the race is on as scheduled. Due to the large size of the race we cannot respond to individual emails or calls in the days leading up to the race asking if the race “might” be postponed or what our “thinking” is about the weather on race day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be no refunds for inclement weather postponements.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the race course?</h3>
    <p>
      The course begins and runs down Riverside Street, then takes a right after Conway Arena toward Stellos Stadium.
      Staying right, runners will enter into beautiful Mine Falls park and run along the river, past the South bridge,
      under the highway, and head right over the bridge by the soccer fields. The paved trail will take you right in
      back toward Nashua South and into the finish by the Rotunda.
      The Little Gobbler 400m fun run starts and finishes at the South Track!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of inclement weather/snow or other conditions, an alternate course may be used.
